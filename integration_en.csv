When a child is on each end of a seesaw, it moves it up and down. The rocking motion demonstrates the principle of cable-tool drilling. To explore the concept further, one could tie a cable to the end of the seesaw and let the cable dangle straight down to the ground. Next, a heavy chisel with a sharp point could be attached to the dangling end of the cable. By adjusting the cable’s length so the end of the seesaw is all the way up, the chisel point hangs a short distance above the ground. Releasing the seesaw lets the heavy chisel hit hard enough to punch a hole in the ground. Repeating the process and rocking the seesaw causes the chisel to drill a hole.;" Paul BOMMER

";Top Green Home Terms;website, 2010;http://www2.epa.gov/science-and-technology;"The heat delivered by a heat pump is theoretically the sum of the heat extracted from the heat source and the energy needed to drive the cycle. The steady-state performance of an electric compression heat pump at a given set of temperature conditions is referred to as the coefficient of performance (COP). 
For engine and thermally driven heat pumps the performance is indicated by the primary energy ratio (PER). The energy supplied is then the higher heating value (HHV) of the fuel supplied. For electrically driven heat pumps a PER can also be defined, by multiplying the COP with the power generation efficiency.
The COP or PER of a heat pump is closely related to the temperature lift, i.e. the difference between the temperature of the heat source and the output temperature of the heat pump. The COP of an ideal heat pump is determined solely by the condensation temperature and the temperature lift (condensation - evaporation temperature).

As researchers take the sample, they note the circumstances, including the exact location, date and time, and name of the researcher taking the sample. A core sample must be accompanied by documentation providing context. This includes notes to indicate which way is up, as this can be important, if a mud sample ends up upside-down, for example, scientists might draw erroneous conclusions on the basis of bad information.

The spiral flow passages are welded at each side and this type of flow is good for handling low density gases which pass through the cross flow. This can be used for liquid-to-liquid applications if one fluid has a much greater flow rate than the other. 
- A second type is the distributed vapor and spiral flow. The coolant moves in a spiral and exits through the top. The hot gases that enter will leave as condensate out of the bottom outlet.  
- The third type is the countercurrent flow where both of the fluids will flow in opposite directions and are used for liquid-to-liquid applications. ";"R. B. KAMARUDDIN

";NREL;Concentrating Solar Power Research;website, 2010;http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/thermal_energy_storage.html;For example, in a cold climate, solar water heating systems require fluids with low freezing points. Fluids exposed to high temperatures, as in a desert climate, should have a high boiling point. Viscosity and thermal capacity determine the amount of pumping energy required. A fluid with low viscosity and high specific heat is easier to pump, because it is less resistant to flow and transfers more heat. Other properties that help determine the effectiveness of a fluid are its corrosiveness and stability.;Energy.gov;Heat Transfer Fluids for Solar Water Heating Systems;website, 2013;http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/heat-transfer-fluids-solar-water-heating-systems;Heat transfer fluid is either completed with its abbreviation (HTF), or even replaced by it in technical texts.
